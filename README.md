# School-District-Analysis
# Summary
The chief data scientist for a school district is assigning me a role to prepare all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation in order to provide information about certain performance trends and patterns. Specifically, I am analyzing every student's math and reading scores, as well as, information about the respective schools they attend. These findings will help create strategic decisions for the district and the schools within it.
